This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [create-next-app](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying app/page.js. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
